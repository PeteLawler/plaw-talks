First annual report of 'Save the Tasmanian Devil Program' produced Dec 2011

Donation focus has shifted from ad-hoc to major sponsorship. Collins-Debden (Diaries) and Virgin Australia major contributors.

Disease suppression work has been attempted, major review in November 2010 indicated impact, but not enough to maintain populations or eradicate disease. Program has ceased.

Insurance grew in 2010/11 from 196 to 294 individuals, expected to exceed 450 by end of 2011.  Focus is on maintaning close to 100% genetic diversity in populations, likely to hit 450-500 by mid 2012.

Work continues on evaluation of fence in far northwest of Tas to isolate estimated 350 devils. Major undertaking financially and logisitcally.

Insurance populations at 20 locations in every state and territory of Australia organised by Zoo and Aquariums Association. Holds two-thirds of insurance population.

Two new Devil Islands (free range enclosures) opened at Freycinet and Bridport in 2010/11, now house 40 devils as part of insurance population.

Devil Ark completed in January 2011, built on 500ha bushland in Barrington Tops, NSW, site chosen due to environment similarity to Tasmania. At time of report writing, 8 of 13 females at Devil Ark have pouch young, indicates conditions are at least heading in right direction.

The Tarkine Devil Program has announced its first results end of last week. The group has captured 1283 images of wild devils in the past few months and not a single one shows evidence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease.
