# plaw-talks

Talks I've given at various places.

(C) varies. Some talks are completely free, others are CC of various types. Others have sections unavailable where I was only able to gain permission to use specifically on the day for the talk, other talks that do not appear here were exclusively licenced.

Except for that one about Drunk Programming. Can't seem to find that one. Yet.

Maybe I should have a drink or three before going looking for it...
